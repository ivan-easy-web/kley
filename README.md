**Kely Studio website**

Multipage website, representing Kley Studio - a Helsinki based digital creative agency. 
They had a beautifull layot in fagma, created by their designer. But it was also very complicated and sometimes hard to implement. 

**My role**

My task was to optimize some pages, blocks, develop the website and upload it to their hosting.
The most important step was to select suitable libraries for implementing complex animations that would allow them to work efficiently, without significantly increasing the page load time and without consuming a lot of resources. Simple Js animations would be slow and resource intensive, so I used Pixi.js liblary.

**Fetures:**
+ a lot of JavaScript animations, such as transitions between pages, moving background animations when scrolling etc
+ realistic animation of the main logo following cursor with Pixi.js

!note Since the design is desktop-first, it's recommended to open it on desktop. Mobile version doesn't contain some interesting animations.
